        <p > <br><br><b>Section One </b><br> <br> A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". 

            Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water.

        <p id="id1"> <br><br><b>Section Two</b> <br><br> Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes.[2] It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.

            Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.

        <p id="tech"><br> <br><b>Section Three</b> <br> <br>Tech City is looking to become a prime location for technology and digital companies to base their offices. A few small companies started the trend of technology companies being based around Old Street and have now developed the area to be the heart of Tech City. It is predicted to become the British Silicon Valley with more than 200 hundred high-tech companies already operating their offices from this central London location.
            Tech City was kick-started by a government initiative in collaboration with some of the biggest companies in the technology industry, such as Cisco, BT and Google. In 2008 there were only 15 high-tech companies based here, which has now expanded to over 200 showing real drive for new businesses around the area. Tech City and some of its biggest clients have been involved with Start-Up Britain to help entrepreneurs move into the area. There is further expected development from UCL, Imperial College and Cisco who have recently announced a research and innovation centre in Tech City, which will act as a magnet for high-quality research talent, to create new ideas and innovations.
            
            Larger corporate companies are also deciding to make the move towards TechCity, such as Amazon opening a digital innovation hub there and Yammer, a private social network for businesses, moving into the area.</p>
